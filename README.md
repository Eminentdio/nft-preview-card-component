## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

During the construction of the project, I learnt a new propety in css - `filter` and how it works.


### Continued development

With FrontEnd Mentor, I think I can remain consistent with my career in coding. At the first stage, it would look like I could not it and along the line, I would feel like I was getting. I want to be confident and be bold.
